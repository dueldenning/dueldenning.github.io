	"overview": "Steve is on a beach. He walks over to the deckchair he has just rented from VeryDangerousChairs Ltd (VDC), holding the stub of his ticket receipt in his hand. As Steve sits down the deckchair folds suddenly and unexpectedly, with Steve inside. It crushes Steve to death. Blood is sprayed upon the beach, staining the clothes of passersby.

Obviously, any damages paid to VDC will take priority over your fee on administration..."
